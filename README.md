fifty day coding challenge
==========================

I will be attempting to write a NEW program for 50 days and explore as many different languages as I can.

If I do not write a new program I will at least make ONE meaningful commit.

=======
Ideas:
1. Web Scraper - in none Python
2. Web Scraper - in python, with as little lines as possible that scrapes same info as the non Python one
3. Some sort of web game
4. Use of a functional language - Probably Clojure or Haskell
5. Implement a QuadTree or Octree
6. Design a mobile App for noting daily living expenses, aim it somehow at college students. Potentially add the ability for them to see how many hours they would need to work to become a millionare by a certain age.
